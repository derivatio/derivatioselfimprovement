    "# Business problem\n",
    "Before we jump into the data we can start defining the problem. Let our project manager give us a problem, users are suddenly churning at a specific point which is Level 28. After realizing this problem the manager asked us this generic question \"Why do users churn at Level 28?\". Then you looked at the level data and the difficulty looked as suspicious data but the level was not the only hardest one in the 25 - 35 levels area. Considering this you started a CausalML to prove your idea is right or not."

    "# Interpretation\n",
    "The estimated causal effect is relatively small, indicating that the number of attempts to pass Level 28, by itself, has a slight increase in the likelihood of user churn. However, it's important to consider this result in the broader context of game design and user experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Game Difficulty: If Level 28 is a significant difficulty spike, even a small increase in churn probability could indicate that users are getting frustrated. It might be beneficial to review the level's design or provide additional support or hints to help users overcome this challenge.\n",
    "* User Engagement: High engagement users might be more willing to attempt difficult levels multiple times, whereas less engaged users might churn more easily. Segmenting users based on engagement levels could provide further insights.\n",
    "* Other Factors: While the analysis controls for several covariates, there could be other factors not included in the model that also influence churn. Continuous monitoring and analysis are essential to understand the multifaceted nature of user churn fully.\n",
    "* In summary, the causal analysis suggests a slight causal effect of the number of attempts to pass Level 28 on user churn, highlighting the importance of level difficulty and user support in game design to enhance user retention."
